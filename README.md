Belly Button Biodiversity Plotly

Bootcamp - Module 14 challenge

This challenge uses JavaScript and Plotly to build a dynamic, interactive dashboard to access and visualize data from the Belly Button Biodiversity experiment.

It uses a drop down menu to select an id corresponding to a test subject, goes on to display a bar chart with the top ten bacterial samples found, the individual's demographic information in another table, a bubble chart that displays each of the sample and a gauge meter that denotes the number of times the individual washes their belly button in a week.
